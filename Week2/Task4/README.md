# Delta Week 2 / Task #4 - Advanced - Triggering an LED sequence with a button

This task will also be purely practical without too much chatter.

## Goals
In this task:
  - It's basically in the title
  - We will also see how we can organise code into functions to make it cleaner and more effective
  

    
## Let's begin
 - Save and close the other Sketches
 - Open the Task4.ino file.
 - The code is ready to upload to the arduino, read the comments I have put in the sketch.
 - From here you can focus on the code, I have left comments on nearly every line, try to understand what it's doing and if you need any help I am happy to explain.
 - Experiment! Don't worry about errors, I will help you fix them. At the end of the day the best way to learn is to make mistakes...


## Next week
In our next Friday session we will look at how to operate a proximity sensor on Arduino and use it as an automatic trigger for various sequences. We will also learn about receiving messages from it to help us know what it is doing.
