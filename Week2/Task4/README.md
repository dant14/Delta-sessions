# Delta Week 2 / Task #4 - Advanced - Triggering an LED sequence with a button

### Key word:
 - *Compile* - verb - the process where the arduino program takes the code and internally chews it up and produces binary files that the device can understand - you'd be shocked to know that pure C code is completely useless to microcontrollers - they need a "compiler" to transform the code we have written into a massive list of 1's and 0's (0010101110101010101111111111010101010101010101...and on it goes)


#### This task will now be practical without any more chatter.

## Goals
In this task:
  - It's basically in the title
  - We will also see how we can organise code into functions to make it cleaner and more effective
  

    
## Let's begin
 - Save and close the other Sketches
 - Open the Task4.ino file.
 - The code is ready to compile(verify) and upload to the arduino, read the comments I have put in the sketch.
 - From here you can focus on the code, I have left comments on nearly every line, try to understand what it's doing and if you need any help I am happy to explain.
 - Experiment! Don't worry about errors, I will help you fix them. At the end of the day the best way to learn is to make mistakes...


## Next week
In our next Friday session we will look at how to operate a proximity sensor and/or a motion sensor on Arduino and use it as an automatic trigger for various sequences. We will also learn about receiving messages from it to help us know what it is doing.
