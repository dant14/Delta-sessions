# Delta Week 4 / Task #1 - Arduino communications again

Welcome to week 4 Electronics.

Due to the fact that we ran out of time last week we shall pick up where we left at task #4. 

The only difference this time is that I have pre-assembled the breadboard circuits so all you have to do is connect each of your boards together by building long connections between them. Yellow goes to yellow, green to green etc. You can of course mix colours of jumpers but don't mix the connections up...

Let's get the Imperial March out of the way so that we can get on with making our COVID-SAFE cap.
