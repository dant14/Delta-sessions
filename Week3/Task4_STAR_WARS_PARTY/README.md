# Delta Week 3 / Task #4 - Inter processor communications - Star Wars style

If you have reached this point, ask me if you are assigned to the Slave or Master part of this task.

## Task #4 Goals

We shall be learning a bit about inter-processor communications. And to see it in action you will have to work together with your friends to connect all the Arduinos in the room for them to work together to play...

### The Imperial Death March

Yup you read that correctly. All the Arduinos in the room will bleep together to Darth Vader's favourite song. But to make that happen, all of you will have to join 'Force' together (pun intended) and help each other otherwise the Resistance will crumble...

## For Slave

Make your way to the [Slave folder](https://github.com/dant14/Delta-sessions/tree/main/Week3/Task4_STAR_WARS_PARTY/Task4_Slave).

## For Master

Well you have done, my young Padawan. Proceed you may now to follow the path of the [Master folder](https://github.com/dant14/Delta-sessions/tree/main/Week3/Task4_STAR_WARS_PARTY/Task4_Master).
